# Example Usage:

# Create Students
student1 = Student(1, "Alice")
student2 = Student(2, "Bob")

# Create Courses
course1 = Course(101, "Mathematics")
course2 = Course(102, "Computer Science")

# Enroll Students in Courses
student1.enroll_course(course1)
student2.enroll_course(course2)

# View Enrolled Courses for Students
student1.view_enrolled_courses()
student2.view_enrolled_courses()

# Add Students to Courses
course1.add_student(student1)
course2.add_student(student2)

# View Enrolled Students for Courses
course1.view_enrolled_students()
course2.view_enrolled_students()

# Assign Grades
grade1 = Grade(student1, course1, "A")
grade2 = Grade(student2, course2, "B")

# Display Grades
grade1.display_grade()
grade2.display_grade()
